Giraffe built the school in 2011 and it is now run by a local NGO.  Tumaini offers hope to hundreds of young children including many  sponsored by the Giraffe Project.

## Giraffe Education Centre

The Giraffe education Centre is our secondary school.  We've located it in a more rural area, close to Nairobi, giving our older students a more tranquil place in which  to study.

Having established the site, we are in the process of handing the school over to our Kenyan partners, and we will continue to support it and send our sponsored students there. 

GEC has around 7 students at the moment, and it will grow to about 200 over time, but the site will need further development before this number can be reached.
