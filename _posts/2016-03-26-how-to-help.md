## Sponsor a child

Sponsoring children is a commitment over many  years, but it's one of the most rewarding ways to help.

For Giraffe kids, the relationship with their sponsor is paramount. If you want to simply donate a regular amount without getting involved, we'll be grateful for your donation, but if you want to really get the most out of your experience we invite you to build a relationship wth  a young Kenyan.

You don't need to go to Kenya, although if you want to we'll be happy to support you in making that trip.  We're there regularly and we can make videos to send to you, and deliver  your videos to your youngsters too. You'll get letters, and we'll hope you'll reply, and there'll be an opportunity to send some gifts during the summer and at Christmas.  

As the kids get older, expect a few gifts back in return.  As with every child's gift, you may not quite know what to do with what you receive, but the fabrics and crafts are enchanting, and whatever you get will have been sent with love and pride.

## Primary sponsorship

Primary school runs to age 14, and sponsorship includes tuition and food, a new uniform once a year, all textbooks, a medical check and annual class outing.
