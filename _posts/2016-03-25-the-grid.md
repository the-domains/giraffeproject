## Welcome to the Giraffe Project

We work in the vast slums of Nairobi.  No one knows how many really live there, but certainly hundreds of thousands, maybe more.

We have one simple goal - to give the kids of Nairobi's slums something that no one can take away from them. An education.

## Trip to Nairobi

Often we take a group of students from Europe to Nairobi.  This year we have 14 people gong, aged between 16 and 17 years old.  

One question we get asked is "Is a trip the best use of the money?"  There's no right answer, except to say that, at Giraffe, we believe in the relationships forged by these trips.  

Those who go and make friends in Kenya have a deeper understanding of the issues, and they never forget that we are dealing with people, not issues.  Those young Kenyans who make friends with Europeans also learn from the experience and realise they share many of the same fears and concerns growing up in the 21st century.
