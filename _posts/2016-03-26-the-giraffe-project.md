Our mission is simple; to give the kids who live in these awful places, something that no one can take away from them. An education.

## Trip to Nairobi 2016

We regularly take groups of European students into the slums of Nairobi for mission trips.  One of the questions we're often asked is, "Are trips the best way to use your money?"   

There's no right answer, except that we believe that having a relationship with someone is vital.  

Young Europeans who meet their counterparts in Kenya never forget the experience, and some of those friendships endure over the years.  And young Kenyans befriending European teens find they  share so many of the same concerns and dreams growing up in the 21st century.
